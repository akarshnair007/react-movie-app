# React Movie App

Welcome to the React Movie App repository! This project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. It allows users to search for movies using the OMDB API. Below, I'll provide you with an overview of the project.

## Features

- **Movie Search:** Users can search for movies by entering keywords in the search bar.
- **Detailed Movie Information:** The app displays detailed information about the selected movie, including title, year, director, actors, plot, and more.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Provides the structure for the web page.
- CSS3: Styles the page for an attractive and user-friendly interface.
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity and handles user input.
- React: Manages the UI components and state of the application.
- OMDB API: Retrieves movie data for the user's search queries.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains JavaScript and React files for defining the components, managing state, and handling API requests.
- `public/`: May contain static assets like images or additional resources.
- `styles/`: Holds CSS files for styling the application.
